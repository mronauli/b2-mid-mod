# README

Base repository for B2 assessments and diagnostics.

This repository requires and has been tested on Ruby v2.5.3 and is based on Rails 5.1.7.

RSpec and Shoulda-Matchers have been installed and set up.


Overview
We are creating an application to track movies. We have  studios, which have movies, and movies have several actors, and actors can be in several movies.
Read each story carefully.
Story 1
As a user,
When I visit the studio index page
I see a list of all of the movie studios
And underneath each studio, I see the names of all of its movies.
Story 2
As a user,
When I visit an actor's show page,
I see their name, their age, and a list of the names of all of the movies they are in.
Story 3
As a user,
When I visit a movie's show page.
I see the movie's name, creation year, and genre,
and a list of all its actors from youngest to oldest.
And I see the average age of all of the movie's actors
Story 4
As a user,
When I visit a movie show page,
I see a form for an actors name
and when I fill in the form with an existing actor's name
I am redirected back to that movie's show page
And I see the actor's name listed
(This should not break story 3, You do not have to test for a sad path)
Story 5
As a user,
When I visit an actor's show page
I see a unique list of all of the actors this particular actor has worked with.
